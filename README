Commited entire oF lib, not only App.
Because we need to use ofThread.
ofThread need to modify core oF lib. 
This is not my tricky hack, but usual requirment for ofThread.
So to keep the same enviroment on any local, I need to commit everything on git.
Since current oF master on the github has ofThread inside in it,
next version oF(007) will have native support for ofThread.
