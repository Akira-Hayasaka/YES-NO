start with a small really rudimetnary shape

evolves as more opinions get added when an opnion gets added a triangle gets added to the convex hull

this triangle is large and then gets smaller like the rest

new triangle can appear with a a differnt color and as if it was contagious all other triangles fade to that color for some time until they go back to the original color

no sphere 
not really like reza's i was thinking more like amorphous shapes not so much like a ball

every facet a different color with a small variation of the surrounding color creating some kind of a gradient effect

have the time affect the size newer entries are bigger or also affect the color so they are almost like a heatmap.
